# Red_vs_Blue
This is an Assessment, Analysis,and Hardening of a Vulnerable System. It was worked on individually and then we collaborated as a group to create the report on findings in this presentation.

Tools used were **Nmap, Hydra, John the Ripper, Metasploit, curl, and MSVenom** to discover vulnerabilities on host machines. 
Used _Filebeat, Packetbeat, and Metricbeat_ to capture data that was then sent to _Kibana_ for further examination. 

Mitigation was provided for each vulnerability found.
